# Entity Framework Core Dynamic Model Builder

## Easily creates Entity Data Model at runtime.

#### Inspired and Core-part cloned from .net framework version, [Dynamix-EntityFramework](https://github.com/ardymalihi/Dynamix-EntityFramework)

By creating DbContext and Poco classes at runtime using C# Compiler, this library helps those developers who want to create complex and dynamic type of applications like ERP/CRM or create dynamic Micro Services whith CRUD operation without writing code.

### How to Use:

#### Creating & Loading:

db = new DbAdapter(ConnectionString);

db.Load();

#### Query:

ie: find a User inside your User Table

var user = (from u in (IEnumerable<dynamic>)db.Instance.User
where u.UserName == "User1"
select u).FirstOrDefault();

#### Creating new object:

##### ie: adding na new user and add to the DbSet

var obj = db.New("User");

obj.UserName = "User2";

obj.Password = "123";

db.Add(obj);

#### Save:

db.Save();

#### Property Names Convention:

db.Instance property has the whole Database Context

Table: dbSet -> TableName (ie: db.Instance.User)
Table With Schema -> SchemaName_TableName (ie:db.Instance.tmp_User )

#### Foriegn Key Object access:
Imagine Product and User Table
Product ( ID, Name, Code, CreatedBy(FK), UpdatedBy(FK)) 
Under Product should be two Virtual properties named CreatedByObject and UpdatedByObject
Also, there should ba two Collection under User named ProductListFromCreatedBy and ProductListFromUpdatedBy

### Note:
IpropertyNotifyChanged has been implemented
It supports entity relationship (navigation properties)
supports multiple primary keys
supports multiple foreign keys

### Limitation:
 - Entity Framework does not allow entity property names to begin with underscore or other illegal characters.
 - Required Primary key for all the tables.
 - Columns cannot have the same name as their own tables.
